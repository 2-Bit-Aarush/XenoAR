# 🧊 Xeno — Virtual 3D Scanner & Viewer

![Xeno Banner](assets/banner.png)

**Xeno** is a **web-based virtual 3D scanning and model viewer application** built using **React + TypeScript**.  
It simulates scanning workflows and allows users to **load, preview, and interact with GLB / 3D models** directly in the browser.

> 🚀 Designed as a learning-focused project with real-world AR / 3D application potential.

---

## ✨ Highlights

- 🧩 Modular and clean React + TypeScript codebase  
- 📦 GLB / 3D model loading and visualization  
- 🖱️ Interactive viewer controls  
- ⚡ Fast development workflow  
- 🔧 Easily extendable to AR / WebXR
